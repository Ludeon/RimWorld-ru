    <Mechanoid_Centipede.description>Heavy combat mechanoids that glide on dozens of tiny legs. Their heavy armor and firepower makes them very effective against bunched-up static defenders. They are somewhat vulnerable to mobile hit-and-run tactics.</Mechanoid_Centipede.description>

    <Mechanoid_Scyther.label>Scyther</Mechanoid_Scyther.label>
    <Mechanoid_Scyther.description>Fast, spindly, human-sized combat mechanoids. They usually carry one primary ranged weapon, and their bodies are adorned with multiple knife-like protrusions to make them deadly in melee combat. They don't use cover. Best handled by concentrated, overwhelming force.</Mechanoid_Scyther.description>
