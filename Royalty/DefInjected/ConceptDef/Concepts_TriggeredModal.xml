  <!-- EN: {PAWN_labelShort} is incapable of social tasks. However, this quest will give {FACTION_royalFavorLabel} and thus royal titles for {PAWN_labelShort}. Those with royal titles have great need of social skills, so if {PAWN_labelShort} gains a title, {PAWN_pronoun} may have a difficult time. With higher titles, colonists will only do social work like trading and negotiating. -->
