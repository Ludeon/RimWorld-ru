  <!-- EN: Authority is a need by holders of certain titles to feel one's stature is respected. Authority is satisfied by reigning in an appropriate throneroom, or by other activities that acknowledge the title-holder's position. This need is greater for those with higher title, and only applies when someone is at a home settlement with others to reign over. -->
